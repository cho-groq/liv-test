 This month I traveled to Stanford University for TreeHacks, their annual collegiate hackathon,

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,760
 not as a participant, but as a sponsor. Here are three things I learned.

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,440
 One, go for sponsored track prizes. For the general track, first, second, and third place overall,

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,760
 you're competing against every hackathon team there. But if you try going for sponsored track

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,060
 prizes, you'll have a better chance of winning them since you'll be competing against less teams.
